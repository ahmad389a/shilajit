    "name": "Origin of Pure Himalayan Shilajit",
    "position": "The plant life in the Himalayan region, which encircles the expanse of China, Tibet, and other regions of Central Asia, is thought to be the source of pure Himalayan Shilajit.Shilajit is a viscous resin that oozes out of crevices in the Himalayan mountains throughout the summer as the heat of the season raises the temperature of the rock. It develops over many years as a result of the decay of plants and the activities of unusual microorganisms like Trifolium Repens and Euphorbia Royleana. Shilajit is thought by experts to be a millennia-old creation of nature because it takes centuries to develop."

    "name": "Ingredients in Pure Himalayan Shilajit",
    "position": "There are allegedly more than 85 ionic minerals in Shilajit. Fulvic Acids, Dibenzo Alpha Pyrones, Humans, Humic Acids, trace minerals, Vitamins A, B, C, and P (citrines), phospholipids and polyphenol complexes, and Terpenoids are the main active constituents in Shilajit. Microelements (cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc, manganese, chrome, iron, magnesium, and others) are additionally present. The majority of shilajit formulations include between 60 and 80 percent fulvic acid, and the more fulvic acid a molecule has, the more anti-aging benefits it has."
